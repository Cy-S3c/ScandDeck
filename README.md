**ScandDeck** is a next-generation network scanning framework built for speed, efficiency, and insight. It goes beyond traditional scanners by providing a comprehensive, structured approach to network discovery and analysis.

## üåü Features

### Current Features (Phase 1)
- **Lightning-Fast Scanning**: Engineered from the ground up in Go for maximum performance
- **Intelligent Host Discovery**: Rapidly identify live hosts within network ranges using multiple techniques
- **High-Speed Port Scanning**: Scan all 65,535 ports faster than traditional tools
- **Service & Version Detection**: Accurately identify services and their versions
- **Structured Output**: Well-organized, parsable results for better analysis and integration
- **Parallel Execution**: Optimized multi-core processing for maximum efficiency
- **Minimal Footprint**: Efficient resource usage even during intensive scans

### Coming Soon
- **Vulnerability Correlation**: Automatic matching of detected services with known CVEs
- **Custom Scripting Engine**: Define custom scan behaviors for specific targets
- **Distributed Scanning**: Coordinate scanning across multiple agents
- **Web Interface**: Intuitive dashboard for scan management and visualization
- **Extensive Plugin System**: Easily extend functionality with custom modules

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

ScandDeck follows a modular architecture designed for performance, extensibility, and maintainability:


### Core Components

1. **Scanning Engine**: High-performance, concurrent scanning implementation
2. **Discovery Module**: Multiple strategies for host discovery
3. **Port Scanner**: Advanced port detection with adaptive timing
4. **Service Analyzer**: Sophisticated service fingerprinting
5. **Result Processor**: Structured data collection and organization
6. **API Layer**: Interfaces for extending and integrating with the framework

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.18 or later
- libpcap development files
- Root/Administrator privileges (for raw socket operations)

### From Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Cy-S3c/ScandDeck.git
cd ScandDeck

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Build the binary
go build -o scandeck ./cmd/scandeck

# Optional: Install system-wide
sudo mv scandeck /usr/local/bin/
```

### Using Go Install
```bash
go install github.com/Cy-S3c/ScandDeck/cmd/scandeck@latest
```

### Docker (Coming Soon)

## üìä Usage Examples

### Basic Network Scan
```bash
# Scan a single host
scandeck scan -t 10.0.0.1

# Scan a network range
scandeck scan -t 192.168.1.0/24

# Scan multiple targets
scandeck scan -t 10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2,10.0.0.5-10
```

### Port-Specific Scanning
```bash
# Scan specific ports
scandeck scan -t 10.0.0.0/24 -p 22,80,443,3389

# Scan port ranges
scandeck scan -t 10.0.0.1 -p 1-1000

# Scan top ports
scandeck scan -t 10.0.0.1 --top-ports 100
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
# Adjust scan intensity (1-5, where 5 is most aggressive)
scandeck scan -t 192.168.1.0/24 --intensity 4

# Output formats
scandeck scan -t 10.0.0.1 --output-format json --output scan-results.json

# Service detection
scandeck scan -t 10.0.0.1 --service-detection deep

# Run specific modules only
scandeck scan -t 10.0.0.1 --modules discovery,portscan --skip service-detection
```

### Scan Profiles
```bash
# Use predefined scan profiles
scandeck scan -t 10.0.0.1 --profile quick
scandeck scan -t 10.0.0.1 --profile thorough
scandeck scan -t 10.0.0.1 --profile stealth
```
